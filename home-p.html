<p>Kurnool is a highly compact, impervious and durable Stone which demands very little maintenance. The stone’s high tolerance to wear and tear, heat and moisture makes it suitable for high-traffic areas, wet areas and exteriors, too.
  Although it is commonly used for flooring, this multifaceted stone can be used as wall cladding, kitchen shelves, cabinet and cupboard shelves, skirting, exterior paving, coping and more.
  The stone’s black colour bestows an intense look to interiors and its tactility complements most interior design styles.Being a vernacular material, it is readily available with nearly all stone dealers in the market. Similarly, it is relatively easy to find skilled labour to install it. Ultimately, acquisition and installation becomes hassle-free and economical. Plus, one gets the green advantage of using a natural material in place of synthetic ones</p><br><br><br><br>
